            $FOM Memes are unique digital creations minted on the Solana
            blockchain. They symbolize the values of hope, resilience, and
            success inspired by FOM’s journey. These memes are not investments
            or securities but are designed to foster community engagement and
            support for underprivileged Ghetto kids globally.

            No, this is not an official product run or managed by FOM. The $FOM
            Meme project is an independent, community-driven initiative inspired
            by his values and journey. While FOM's story serves as the
            inspiration, he is not involved in managing or overseeing the
            project, his role is symbolic.

            A meme is a digital expression, often in the form of an image, text,
            or artwork, that conveys a cultural or emotional idea. In the
            context of the $FOM Meme project, memes are unique digital creations
            minted on the blockchain that represent values like hope,
            resilience, and success. These memes are symbols of solidarity and
            community, inspiring people to support the movement and its mission
            to uplift underprivileged Ghetto kids worldwide.
